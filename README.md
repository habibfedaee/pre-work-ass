Hi
My name is Habibullah Fedaee, I am applying for the CTD React.js and Node.js/Express classes for the following semester.

I read the requirements and assignment, I was very interested to try this course and complete the assignment in order to be able to get enrolled.

Based on the Pre-work Assignment Requirements, I chose the weather API task.

The structure for the Application is very simple. 
1. Basic html file --> to create the UI
2. Basic css file --> to style the UI
3. Basic vanilla JavaScript --> to make the UI work and fetch the required data from open-meteo API and render it inside the UI.
4. I used some helper data (eg. city name to gps coordinates ) in order to be able to communicate with weather API. I added a file inside data/cities.csv to hold these coordinates.
5. Since i was new to API and i just limited my API calls to only Weather API.
***. I did my best to do what was actually required and I came up with this solution. I know there are lots of things missing. I hope I get the chance to learn what you guys offer.

Thank you,
